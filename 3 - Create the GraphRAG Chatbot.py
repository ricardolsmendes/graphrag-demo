# MAGIC ## The importance of MLflow
# MAGIC
# MAGIC MLflow plays a key role in tracking and debugging the GraphCypherQAChain workflow. It lets you monitor model versioning, performance metrics, and artifacts, making deployment seamless and transparent. With MLflow, you can easily trace and optimize the outputs of the LLMs within its interface.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC We are speaking prular as we use two different LLMs: 
# MAGIC -  the one stored in the variable `qa_llm`, is for managing the Q&A part
# MAGIC - the one stored in the variable `cypher_llm` is for managing the Text-2-Cypher conversion
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Each LLM has its own prompt as they're serving for different purposes.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC Before moving forward, you can deploy your own Text-2-Cypher model by executing [this notebook]($./3.1 - Provisioned Throughput text2cypher serving example)

# COMMAND ----------

'''
Now you can choose to use the `text2cypher-demo-16bit` model deployed in the notebook linked above or use whatever other LLM you want, as for instance in the commented code for using gpt-4.

# MAGIC ## Create and Test GraphRAG Chain
# MAGIC Now that we have defined our pretrained LLM and fine-tuned text2cypher model, and our data is loaded into the Neo4j graph database, we can then work on defining our agent. Details can be found in notebook.

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Naive Chain
# MAGIC The Naive Chain approach involves using a pretrain LLM for both Cypher query generation and answer summarization, without the aid of advanced prompts or configurations. In this setup, GPT-4.0 is utilized as the primary model, where it takes in a user query, interprets it, generates the Cypher query, executes it against the Neo4j database, and finally summarizes the results. While this approach is straightforward, it may not fully leverage the flexibility and performance offered by using separate LLMs or more detailed prompts.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC An example code and results to use GPT-4.0 for this naive chain would look as follows:

# COMMAND ----------

# Create a GraphCypherQAChain instance using a language model from Databricks and the Neo4j graph
chain = GraphCypherQAChain.from_llm(
    # Pass the language model for the Q&A part
    qa_llm=qa_llm,
    # Use the predefined Cypher generation prompt template for the Q&A part
    qa_prompt=qa_prompt,
    # Pass the Neo4j graph instance
    graph=graph,
    # Enable verbose mode for detailed logging
    verbose=True,
    # Return intermediate steps for debugging
    return_intermediate_steps=True,
    # Pass the language model for the Text2Cypher part
    cypher_llm=cypher_llm,
    # Use the predefined Cypher generation prompt template for the Text2Cypher part
    cypher_prompt=cypher_prompt,
    # Allow potentially dangerous requests
    allow_dangerous_requests=True,
    # Validate the generated Cypher queries
    validate_cypher=False
) | RunnableLambda(lambda x: x["result"]) # The RunnableLambda step is used for properly extracting the result

# COMMAND ----------

# Log the GraphCypherQAChain instance as an MLflow model
mlflow.models.set_model(model=chain)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Log the chain
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Once the GraphRAG chain is logged, you can use chain.invoke() to pass a natural language query into the `GraphCypherQAChain`. The output includes the Cypher query and summarized response, enabling you to identify issues like query inaccuracies or misinterpretations. Testing the GraphRAG system in Databricks notebooks with MLflow tracing helps iteratively improve accuracy and reliability, ensuring it meets complex use cases like cybersecurity analysis or large-scale graph data retrieval.

# COMMAND ----------

# if it's not ran from the Databricks model serving endpoint please run this for debug
if not dot_env_path.exists():
  response = chain.invoke("Can you show potiential attack paths in our network to high value targets? Return the first five results")
